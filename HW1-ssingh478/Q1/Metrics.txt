Average Node Degree: 1.937 (It's an estimate of average connections per node.It is calculated by adding the total number of edges connected to each nodes and dividing by the total number of nodes.)
Diameter of the graph: 8 (It measures the distance between two most faraway nodes in terms of no. of nodes)
Average Path Length: 2.291 (It's an estimate of average of shortest distances between all possible pair of nodes.)
