I used Forced Atlas algorithm for layout analysis because this very network is small-world.
I kept repulsion strength to be 100, attraction strength to be 10, Gravity to be 30 and ticked the adjust by sizes to avoid node overlap.
I sized nodes on basis of betweenness centrality (this is a ranking on the basis of how many times a node will be traveled if we take all the shortest path from all nodes to all modes on the graph)
and colored them on basis of modularity class to create clusters.
